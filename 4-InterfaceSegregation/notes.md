# Interface Segregation Principle - ISP

- Divide big intergaces in small single responsibility one
- Disengage components to enable them to grow ordered
- Similar to single responsibility principle but applied to interfaces.

## Conclussions
I have been testing different ways to use interfaces and import them into different classes, following the principle of Interface Segregation. 
I also tested many other things on the way, like project references through the IDE or via .csproj, as well as how interfaces and permissions interact with classes that import the elements of the interface
